 # Get the code: `svn checkout http://bccapi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ bccapi`
 # Compile the jar: `cd bccapi && ant clean bccapi-jar`
 # The jar file is located here: bccapi/build/jar/bccapi.jar

== Using a Pre-Built JAR ==
Software needed: [http://www.java.com/en/download/ JRE] or [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html JDK] 
 # Download [http://code.google.com/p/bccapi/downloads/list bccapi.jar]

== Testing it on the Bitcoin Test Network==
